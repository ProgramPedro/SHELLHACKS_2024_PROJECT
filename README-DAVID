Sorry i put all my files up at ones i wish i created a folder so it looked nicer lol my bad
first time using Git

So basically Window.java is the code that opens a window on your screen where u can put in 
inputs. Whenever u hit print it takes the input and assigns it to a String varible called
"text" to JsonCreater.java called in Window.java which creates the input.json file

input.json will be overriden everytime new information is inputed.

Main.java is just a sample of how it worked originally by reading the console and 
creating a json file

So my files are input.java  JsonCreator.java  Main.java  and input.json

Sorry again for like dumping it idk how to make like an input folder then 
all my code
