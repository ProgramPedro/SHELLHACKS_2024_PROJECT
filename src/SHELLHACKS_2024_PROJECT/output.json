{"Response": {"Explanation": "The most abundant rock on Earth is basalt. Basalt is a dark, fine-grained volcanic rock that makes up a significant portion of the Earth's oceanic crust. It forms from the rapid cooling and solidification of lava that erupts onto the surface. In addition to being found on ocean floors, basalt is also found in some continental areas, particularly where volcanic activity has occurred. Its composition is primarily made up of plagioclase and pyroxene minerals, and due to its density and properties, it plays a crucial role in the geology of the Earth.\n\nNow, let's work through a practice problem related to this topic.\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SETq8YkcnxE (What is the most abundant mineral in the Earth&#39;s crust?  #shortsvideo)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxqc8yuhEqw (15 MOST Unbelievable Rock Formations From Earth&#39;s Past)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISfIyCpgfPw (What is the most abundant sediment on Earth?)\n\n", "Question": "\n\n**Practice Problem:** Which type of rock is considered the most abundant on Earth?\n\nA) Granite  \nB) Sandstone  \nC) Basalt  \nD) Limestone  \n\n", "Answer": "\n\nThe correct answer is C) Basalt. Basalt is the most abundant rock on Earth, particularly in the oceanic crust, while granite, sandstone, and limestone are less common overall. \n\n", "Output": "", "correctAnswer": 3}}
