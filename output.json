  "Explanation": "To find the equation of the tangent line to a function at a given point using the limit definition of the derivative, we start by recalling what the derivative represents. The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a specific point $a$ can be defined as:\n\n$$ f'(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} $$\n\nThis formula gives us the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point $(a, f(a))$. Once we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$$ y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a) $$\n\nLet\u2019s break the process into steps:\n1. Identify the function $f(x)$ and the point $a$ where we want to find the tangent line.\n2. Calculate the derivative $f'(a)$ using the limit definition.\n3. Use the point-slope formula to write the equation of the tangent line.\n\nNow, let\u2019s work through an example problem.\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8 (Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc (Python Tutorial - Python Full Course for Beginners)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8pPdKYpowI (Python Tutorial for Beginners - Learn Python in 5 Hours [FULL COURSE])\n\n", 
  "Question": "\n\n**Practice Problem:**\n\nFind the equation of the tangent line to the function $f(x) = x^2$ at the point $a = 2$.\n\na) $y = 2x - 2$  \nb) $y = 4x - 4$  \nc) $y = 4x - 4$  \nd) $y = 4x - 8$  \n\n", 
  "Answer": "\n\n**Answer Explanation:**\n\n1. First, we need to find $f'(2)$ using the limit definition:\n   - $f(2) = 2^2 = 4$.\n   - Now, calculate the derivative:\n   $$ f'(2) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(2 + h)^2 - 4}{h} $$\n   - Expanding $(2 + h)^2$, we have:\n   $$ = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(4 + 4h + h^2) - 4}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{4h + h^2}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} (4 + h) = 4. $$\n   So, $f'(2) = 4$.\n\n2. Now that we have the slope $f'(2) = 4$ and the point $(2, f(2)) = (2, 4)$, we can write the equation of the tangent line using point-slope form:\n   $$ y - 4 = 4(x - 2). $$\n   Simplifying this gives us:\n   $$ y - 4 = 4x - 8 \\implies y = 4x - 4. $$\n\nThus, the correct answer is **b) $y = 4x - 4$.**"
