{"Response": {"Explanation": "To find the area under a curve, we use the concept of integration. Specifically, the definite integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ gives us the area between the curve $y = f(x)$, the x-axis, and the vertical lines $x = a$ and $x = b$. The formula for the definite integral is written as:\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\n$$\n\nThis integral calculates the accumulation of the area infinitesimally as we sum up the areas of infinitely thin rectangles under the curve from $x = a$ to $x = b$. If the function $f(x)$ is above the x-axis in this interval, the integral will yield a positive value. Conversely, if the function is below the x-axis, the integral will yield a negative value. \n\nIt's also important to note that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration. If $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, then:\n\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = F(b) - F(a)\n$$\n\nNow, let\u2019s work through a practice problem.\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsC3do74UIo (What is Integration?
