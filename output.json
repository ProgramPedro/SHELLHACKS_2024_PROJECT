{"Response": {"Explanation": "Certainly! To prove that the square root of 2 is irrational, we can use a proof by contradiction. This means that we will assume the opposite. \n\n**Step 1: Assumption**  \nLet\u2019s assume that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational. This means that it can be expressed as a fraction in its simplest form:  \n\\[\n\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}\n\\]  \nwhere \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers that have no common factors (other than 1), and \\(b \\neq 0\\).\n\n**Step 2: Squaring both sides**  \nIf we square both sides of the equation, we get:  \n\\[\n2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\n\\]  \nMultiplying both sides by \\(b^2\\), we get:  \n\\[\n2b^2 = a^2\n\\]  \n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the results**  \nThis equation implies that \\(a^2\\) is an even number (since it\u2019s equal to \\(2b^2\\), which is clearly even). Since the square of an odd integer is odd, it follows that \\(a\\) must also be even (if \\(a\\) were odd, \\(a^2\\) would be odd).\n\n**Step 4: Expressing \\(a\\) in terms of an even integer**  \nSince \\(a\\) is even, we can express it as:  \n\\[\na = 2k\n\\]  \nfor some integer \\(k\\).\n\n**Step 5: Substituting back into the equation**  \nSubstituting \\(a\\) back into the equation \\(2b^2 = a^2\\), we have:  \n\\[\n2b^2 = (2k)^2\n\\]  \nThis simplifies to:  \n\\[\n2b^2 = 4k^2\n\\]  \nDividing both sides by 2 gives us:  \n\\[\nb^2 = 2k^2\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Analyzing \\(b^2\\)**  \nThis result shows that \\(b^2\\) is also even, which means that \\(b\\) must also be even.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion**  \nSince both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are even, they share a common factor of 2, contradicting our original assumption that they have no common factors (since they were supposed to be in simplest form). \n\nTherefore, the assumption that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational is false, which means that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.\n\n", "Question": "\n\n**Practice Question:**  \nIf \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is not a rational number, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed as a fraction with integers.  \nB) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed as a non-repeating decimal.  \nC) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed as a terminating decimal.  \nD) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is equal to 1.5.\n\n", "Answer": "\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe correct answer is B) \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be expressed as a non-repeating decimal."}}
