{"Response": {"Explanation": "To find the area under a curve, we often use definite integrals. The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ gives us the total area between the curve and the x-axis, spanning the interval from $a$ to $b$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$A = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx$$\n\nTo compute this area, you need to find the antiderivative (also known as the integral) of the function $f(x)$, evaluate it at the upper limit $b$ and lower limit $a$, and then subtract:\n\n$$A = F(b) - F(a)$$\n\nwhere $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$.\n\nFor example, if we want to find the area under the curve of the function $f(x) = x^2$ from $x=1$ to $x=3$, we would:\n\n1. Find the antiderivative: $F(x) = \\frac{x^3}{3}$.\n2. Evaluate it at the limits: $F(3) = \\frac{3^3}{3} = 9$ and $F(1) = \\frac{1^3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n3. Compute the area: \n\n$$A = F(3) - F(1) = 9 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{26}{3}.$$\n\nNow, let's work through a practice problem.\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsC3do74UIo (What is Integration?
