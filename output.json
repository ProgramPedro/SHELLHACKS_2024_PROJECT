{"Response": {"Explanation": "To find the area under a curve between two points on a graph, we typically utilize the definite integral. The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$, represented as $\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx$, computes the net area between the curve $y = f(x)$ and the x-axis, from $x = a$ to $x = b$. \n\nIf $f(x)$ is positive on the interval $[a, b]$, the area is simply the integral's value. However, if $f(x)$ is negative, the integral will yield a negative value, which then represents an area below the x-axis. To find the total area, you would integrate the absolute value over that interval.\n\nFor instance, if we have the function $f(x) = x^2$ and we want to find the area under this curve from $x = 1$ to $x = 3$, we calculate:\n\n$$\n\\int_1^3 x^2 \\, dx\n$$\n\nFirst, we find the antiderivative of $x^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^3}{3}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate it from $1$ to $3$:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{3^3}{3} - \\frac{1^3}{3}\\right] = \\left[9 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right] = \\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{26}{3}\n$$\n\nThis gives us the area under the curve $f(x) = x^2$ from $x=1$ to $x=3$.\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsC3do74UIo (What is Integration?
