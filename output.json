{"Response": {"Explanation": "To find the area under a curve, we typically use definite integrals. The area \\( A \\) under a curve defined by a function \\( f(x) \\) from \\( x = a \\) to \\( x = b \\) can be calculated using the definite integral:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis integral calculates the net area between the function \\( f(x) \\) and the x-axis, over the interval from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\). If \\( f(x) \\) is above the x-axis, the area is positive, and if it is below the x-axis, the area is considered negative.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, you find the antiderivative \\( F(x) \\) of \\( f(x) \\), and then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n\n\\[\nA = F(b) - F(a)\n\\]\n\nLet's say you want to find the area under the curve of \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) from \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute the antiderivative:\n   \\[\n   F(x) = \\frac{x^3}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. Evaluate the definite integral from 1 to 3:\n   \\[\n   A = F(3) - F(1) = \\left(\\frac{3^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1^3}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{27}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 9 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{27}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{26}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area under the curve \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) from \\( x = 1 \\) to \\( x = 3 \\) is \\( \\frac{26}{3} \\).\n\n(Extra Resources): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjTTx2eYrx8 (Finding The Area Under The Curve Using Definite Integrals - Calculus)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsC3do74UIo (What is Integration?
